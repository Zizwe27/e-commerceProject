## Collaboration Guidelines

We welcome contributions to the **E-commerce Platform Project**! Follow these step-by-step instructions to contribute:

---

### 1. Fork the Repository

- Go to the [main repository](https://github.com/Zizwe27/e-commerceProject) on GitHub.
- Click the **Fork** button (top right of the page).
- This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

---

### 2. Clone Your Fork Locally

- On your forked repo page, click the **Code** button and copy the URL (HTTPS or SSH).
- Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/e-commerceProject.git
cd e-commerceProject
```

---

### 3. Configure the Main Repository as `upstream`

This allows you to keep your fork up to date with the original repository.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Zizwe27/e-commerceProject.git
```

---

### 4. Create a New Branch

- Always create a branch for your feature or fix.
- Branch names should be descriptive, like `feature/user-profile` or `bugfix/fix-cart-total`.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

---

### 5. Make Your Changes

- Edit/add code, documentation, or tests as needed.
- Follow the project's coding guidelines and standards.

---

### 6. Commit Your Changes

- Stage your changes:

```bash
git add .
```

- Commit with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Add feature for user profile management"
```

---

### 7. Keep Your Branch Up to Date (Recommended)

- Before pushing, sync with the latest changes from the main repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git rebase main
```

---

### 8. Push Your Branch to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

---

### 9. Create a Pull Request

- Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
- You should see a **Compare & pull request** button â€” click it.
- Fill out the PR form with:
  - **A clear title**
  - **A detailed description** of your changes and motivation
  - **Any related issue numbers** (e.g., `Closes #42`)
- Submit the pull request.

---

### 10. Respond to Review

- Make any requested changes and push updates to your branch. Your PR will update automatically.

---

### 11. Pull Request Merging

- Once approved, your pull request will be merged.

---

**Tips for Successful Collaboration:**
- Keep your changes focused and atomic (one feature or fix per branch/PR).
- Reference issues in your pull request for context.
- Run tests before submitting.
- Be responsive to feedback.
